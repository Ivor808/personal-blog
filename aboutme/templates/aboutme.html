<h1>About Me!</h1>
<body> My name is Ivor Zalud and I am currently in a Masterâ€™s program in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I currently work as a Client Reporting Analyst at BlackRock. While I enjoyed the client interactions, I have realized that my strengths lie in the technical aspects of the job. As a client reporting analyst, I developed a variety of skills necessary for success in the field of Computer Science including: Effective communication skills for internal/external stakeholders, and automation with Python/SQL. In my MSCS program I have programmed in Java, C, Python, and SQL. I love to learn new skills and technology to then apply to my job. I am also analytical and enjoy taking complex problems and creating solutions. I believe that my experience as a Client Reporting analyst in conjunction with the skills I am developing in my MSCS program, will make me a valuable contributor to this industry. My current goal is to find a position in the fintech field that leverages my Client Reporting and MSCS skills.</body>
